# E-Commerce API Introduction

This E-Commerce API project serves as the backend for an e-commerce platform. The API is built using Node.js and Express, providing a robust and scalable solution for managing product data, user authentication, and order processing. MongoDB is used as the database, and Mongoose is utilized for object data modeling (ODM). The project is structured to handle various e-commerce functionalities, including product listing, user authentication (registration, login, and logout), and managing customer orders. The API also includes security enhancements like rate limiting and sanitization to prevent common vulnerabilities.

## üîó Backend API - Fully Developed & Ready to Use
